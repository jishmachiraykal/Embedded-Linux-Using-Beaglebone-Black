This project demonstrates the setup and use of Embedded Linux on the BeagleBone Black (BBB) platform. The BBB is a low-cost, ARM-based single-board computer designed for embedded applications and prototyping. This guide covers flashing a Linux-based OS , configuring device interfaces and deploying embedded applications. It also includes basic hardware initialization, kernel configuration tips, and instructions for cross-compilation and debugging. Ideal for developers building IoT, robotics, or industrial control systems using the BeagleBone Black
